# Conch

Database build and management service

# Setup

Conch uses `carton` to manage dependencies. Install `carton` and run `carton
install` or `make deps` in the `Conch/` directory.



# Endpoints

I am going to *strongly* recommend using [HTTPie](https://httpie.org) for
testing the endpoints in the command-line. Managing cookies and JSON encoding
with cURL is a pain, and HTTPie manages it well. All endpoint examples will be
done with HTTPie. The executable for HTTPie is `http`.

## Login

### Logging In

Sets up a session with appropriate priviledges for subsequent requests.
Sessions are referenced by a cookie, so the cookie will need to be stored and
used in following requests.

There is a special `admin` user that has the username `"admin"` with a
shared-secret password. The admin user has priviledges for endpoints a regular
user does not have.

* URL

  `/login`

* Methods

  `POST`

* Payload

  `{ "user": "$USER_NAME", "password": "$PASSWORD" }`

* Authorization

  None, as this provides the means to get authorization

* Success Response:

  * `200`

* Error Response:

  * `401 Unauthorized`

  `{ "error" : "failed login attempt" }`

  * `500`

  Big catch-all for now. Something went wrong. Check the logs.

* Example request

  ```
  http POST :5000/login --session admin_session <<EOF
  { "user" : "admin", "password": "hunter2" }
  EOF
  ```

## Device Reports

### Creating device report

Takes a JSON blob created by `export.pl` and processes it.

* URL

  `/device/:serial`

* Methods

  `POST`

* Payload

  JSON blob generated by `export.pl`

* Authorization

  Requires integrator account and session.

* Success Response:

  * `200`

* Error Response:

  * `500`

  Big catch-all for now. Something went wrong. Check the logs

* Example request

  ```
  http POST :5000//device/A8CD3FG < report_from_HB.json
  ```

### Retrieving device inventory and validation report

Takes a serial number. Returns a JSON blob.

The most recent validation report is returned as an array.

* URL

  `/device/:serial`

* Methods

  `GET`

* Authorization

  Requires integrator account and session.

* Success Response:

  * `200`

* Error Response:

  * `401`

  Unauthorized or device does not exist.

* Example request

  ```
  http :5000/device/45M2ND2 --session account
  ```

## Updating device location

Takes a serial number, the rack UUID, and the rack slot.

If the device does not yet exist, will create a stub entry in the device table.

Will not let you clobber an occupied slot, and verifies that the slot you want to use exists.

* URL

  `/device/:serial/location`

* Methods

 `POST`

* Authorization

  Requires integrator account and session.

* Success Response:

  * `200`

* Error Response:

  * `401`

  Unauthorized or device does not exist.

  * `500`

  Something went wrong while trying to update the record. See the logs.

* Example request

  ```
  http :5000/device/location/45M2ND2 --session account <<EOF
  { "device": "$SERIAL", "rack": "$RACK_UUID", "rack_unit": "$RACK_UNIT" }
  EOF
  ```

## Racks

### Retrieving available racks

* URL

  * `/rack`

### Retrieve layout for specific rack

* URL

  * `/rack/:uuid`

### Bulk updating a rack layout

Returns `updated` and `errors` arrays.

* URL

  `/rack/:uuid/layout`

* Method

  `POST`


Takes a JSON blob in the form

```
{
  "$SERIAL": $RACK_UNIT,
  "$SERIAL": $RACK_UNIT,
  "$SERIAL": $RACK_UNIT
}
```

* Example request

```
http POST :5000/7d7665d3-9244-42d6-bad8-f9505a9380ae/layout --session account <<EOF
{
  "BAENG1O": 3,
  "45M2ND2": 1
}
EOF
```

## User

### Creating integrator user

Creates a new integrator user with a randomly generated 8-digit password.

* URL

  `/user`

* Methods

  `POST`

* Payload

  `{ "user" : "$NEW_USER_NAME" }`

* Authorization

  Requires logged-in admin

* Success Response:

  * `201 Created`

  `{ "user": "${new user name}", "password": "${generated password}" }`

* Error Response:

  * `401 Unauthorized`

  Unauthorized. Log in as admin first

  * `500`

  Big catch-all for now. Something went wrong. Check the logs.

* Example request

  ```
  http POST :5000/user --session admin_session <<EOF
  { "user" : "some_integrator_username" }
  EOF
  ```

### Setting user datacenter access

Set the access permissions for a set of users for a set a datacenter rooms.

**NOTE:** Without BHDA access, I decided to use AZs as identifiers for the
datacenter rooms. We need a unique value that can identify a datacenter room.
We could also use the vendor name, but that's null-able. AZs are not unique, so
we could have multiple datacenter rooms with the same AZ (is this desired?).

* URL

  `/datacenter_access`

* Methods

  `PUT`

  This is an idempotent operation, so it is a **PUT** request rather than POST.

* Payload

  The payload is a JSON object with user names as keys, an a list of AZ names as values.

  ```
  { "${INTEGRATOR_NAME}" : ["${DATACENTER_ROOM_AZ}", ... ]}
  ...
  }
  ```

  **NOTE:** You can remote all user access by associating a list with
  non-existing datacenter names. e.g., `{ "no_access_user" : ["__NO_ACCESS__"] }`.
  Ideally, you could set this with a empty list, but because of how Perl
  handles hashes, this is a bug for now.

* Authorization

  Requires logged-in admin

* Success Response:

  * `200 Created`

  No payload in response.


* Error Response:

  * `401 Unauthorized`

  Unauthorized. Log in as admin first

  * `500`

  Big catch-all for now. Something went wrong. Check the logs.

* Example request

  ```
  http PUT :5000/datacenter_access --session admin_session <<EOF
  { "integrator_1234" : ["ap-southeast-1a"] }
  EOF
  ```

## Devices

### Listing integrator accessible devices

List all of the devices a given integrator has premissioned access for, as
granted by `PUT /datacenter_access`.

* URL

  `/device`

* Methods

  `GET`

* Authorization

  Requires logged-in **integrator** user. Currently, an admin does not have
  access to this endpoint (we need to decide how this should be used by an
  admin).

* Success Response:

  * `200 Created`

  `{ "devices": [...list of devices...] }`

* Error Response:

  * `401 Unauthorized`

  Unauthorized. Log in as an integrator first

  * `500`

  Big catch-all for now. Something went wrong. Check the logs.

* Example request

  ```
  http :5000/user --session integrator_session
  ```
